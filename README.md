Goal: The user should be able to type into the input and, when they click a button, change the greeting to whatever they want.

We need to see on the screen/manipulate: (this ends up being a list of everything that needs an id in javascript)

Greeting
Text input
Button
Let's go grab everything we need:

grab the greeting
Validate by logging out
grab the input
Validate by logging out
grab the button
Validate by logging out
When do we want this to happen? When the user clicks the button:

OnClick of the button:

Validate that the button is listening
Log out the current time on click
Get the user input from the text input element
log out the userInput
Change the textContent property of the greeting element
change it it 'whatever' first, to validate our process
change it to the userInput
